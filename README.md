# Sorting.py

## What is Sorting.py?

Sorting.py is a project with the python implementation of common sorting algorithms.

-   Algorithms folder holds the source code for all the algorithms.
-   Utility.py holds basic utility functions.
-   Driver.py tests the functionality of algorithms and verifies if they work. (It is also automated by Github Actions)

## To-Do

Make sorting.py algorithms use iterables.
Add more algorithms.
Clean up file structure.

## How to contribute?

Contributing is really easy, just create a new Algorithm in the Algorithms folder,
import it into driver.py and then add it to the AlgorithmsList. To test your code
run `python driver.py`.
